Deployed with Glitch. View project here: https://acid-with-highscore.glitch.me/

     A dance app created as a response to the brief "Care and Play".
     Inspired by the Acid House dance movement in 1980's UK, it uses
     machine learning, computer vision and PoseNet Body Estimation to
     encourage people to dance and move around to combat their sedentary
     lifestyle. Made with p5.js, TensorFlow.js, Socket.IO, Express and LowDB.
